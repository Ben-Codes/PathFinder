PathFinder is a simple HTML Canvas to manipulate and visually demonstrate the A* algorithm in a client server setup.

### TODO:

*  Widen browser support. (IE11, Chrome)
*  Parallelize adajacent node search.
*  Offload route search from web server.
*  Optimize Heurestic - currently using Manhattan leads to occasional sub optimal route.
